now, lemme get this out of the way first. yes, I know my Blog is empty. I had pushed this task a long time ago and I'll be frank, I can't seem to figure out how to update it via github. my solution to it would normally be to just make another repository, with
an updated Blog but i unfortunately don't have much time left before the submission time ends, so this is the end resuly.

I used PaperMod cause some functions work only in certain hugo profiles. I think I switched mine twice or thrice before I finally settled on papermod mod cause I heard it was easy compared to some other ones.
once I got a theme that was simple, the task got much easier
