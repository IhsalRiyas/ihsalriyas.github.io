now, lemme get this out of the way first. yes, I know my Blog is empty. I had pushed this task a long time ago and I'll be frank, I can't seem to figure out how to update it via github. my solution to it would normally be to just make another repository, with
an updated Blog this itme but It feels like a waste of time, especially considering that it's 2:15 AM right now and I really need to sleep but these guys from other rooms do not believe in the concept of sleeping.

I used PaperMod cause some functions work only in certain hugo profiles. I think I switched mine twice or thrice before I finally settled on papermod mod cause I heard it was easy compared to some other ones.
Honestly, I don't remember most of what I did since I followed a yt tutorial for the most part. of course, if you asked me how I did it in an interview, I will confidently tell you the whole process, but try telling about the date of interview at least
3 hours earlier since mugging up isn't my speciality.

oh also, my future readme files all have ascii art in it but for some reason, they repeat and sometimes don't align as well, so here's me hoping it works here.
