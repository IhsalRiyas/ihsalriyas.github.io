<p>Hi. My name is Ihsal Riyas. a weird name I know. most people call me ishal instead. or CR if you&rsquo;re from my class. call me whatever you want to be honest, as long as the permutation is close enough.
to be honest, I wasn&rsquo;t really sure as to what I should write here since I wrote pretty much everything about me during the amFOSS introduction on discord which lead to a brillaint idea. why CREATE new content when you can STEAL?!</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s right gentlemen. I am going to copy paste my discord intro here. And before someone says, that isn&rsquo;t the assignment, let me just say my intro was lietrally split into 3 messages since the intro was too big. I don&rsquo;t think this hugo site of mine is going to be particularly brillaint in design but if there&rsquo;s one thing I&rsquo;m proud of, its being funny. well, I try to be anyways.
anyways here&rsquo;s me boiled down:
Hi, everyone!
My name is Ihsal Riyas(pronounced eh-sa-l, or ishal if you want. My name is quite annoying to say so I don’t mind anyone mispronouncing it as long as they are somewhat close). I’m a CSE-AI student at S1. My hobbies include(takes a deep breath) : anime, manga, manhwa, manhua, lightnovels, fiction(generally fantasy and a bit of a dabble in sci-fi), webnovels and of course webtoons( I only read like 4 of them so far but God is it amazing). Oh, drawing and movies as well.
Of course I Read the Lord of the rings and it was . . . fine? Don’t get me wrong, there is definitely an audience for it but I’m afraid my fight loving mind wasn’t one of them. Like I was so obsessed with completing the story, I didn’t realise the villain was quite LITERALLY the tower! I just assumed he used the tower to spy and stuff. And before someone blames my attention span, let me just say I’m a huge fan of GOT and I understood 40% of all the foreshadowing (impressive, I know)
Anyways that was quite a tangent? That was this about again? Oh ya, the icebreaker thing! I studied abroad (Oman, to be exact) up to my 10th grade. 11th was technically in kerela though I hardly can acknowledge that since I never even visited my school. Even the final exam was online. 12th was a pain. I decided to repeat at rays( a coaching centre at Kozhicode). since I wanted to actually learn the things I should have .for eg, while I have heard of Markonikov in 12th, it was always in reference to 11th and it was only after school I learned about it. Since I studied abroad for a while, I prefer speaking in English. While Malayalam is my mother tongue, it is unfortunately also my second language , so to speak.
I should probably talk about my coding background. Do I have any? Kinda? I did learn python in school but I didn’t really have any other experience before that. Then I joiuned the recruitment process for bi0s since I heard the best clubs for codind are Bi0s and amFOSS. I have never felt as dumfounded as I did when I started doing the ‘easy;’ task on bi0s. like what is the hell is Ubuntu? Burp suite? Wireshark? i stlll remember how little I felt when I couldn’t even solve the easy ones in the first week or so. At the moment, its much easier. I understand how most of them work, if only on a surface level.
Do I have a passion for coding? I don’t know to be honest. I have a passion for drawing but it isn’t something I actively do. I do it when I ‘m bored or just want to do something. Of course, I throw my fist in the air when the code I wrote for half an hour works perfectly and call myself a GENIUS. But I also die on the outside and cry on the inside when I realise the code wasn’t working because I forgot a goddamm semicolon (side note: why semicolon of all things? I can understand if it was a full stop. We use full stop to end a sentence but it’s a semicolon to finish a line on a program. Why semicolon?!)
Anyways that’s about all I want to say. Any more and I might end up running out of characters on discord. I look forward to hopefully joining the amFOSS family(lol, I actually did run out of characters, well that&rsquo;s why this was a 3 part msg)</p>
<p>this was my intro at the beginning of amFOSS. its not a lot different now to be honest. except fot the coding part. I&rsquo;ve realized I have a deeper hatered than I initailly thought. one day, I am goingot kill the man who created the semicolon as an ending characters for programming languages.</p>
<p>~                                                                                                                                                                                                               <br>
